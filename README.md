### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Hang Li.

I am currently a PhD candidate at ielab in The University of Queensland, Australia, I work with Dr. Guido Zuccon and Dr. Bevan Koopman. I was granted the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities in United States in 2016.

I am working at the intersection of Conversational Search, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML) applications, where I utilises different relevance feedbacks to empower the conversational search system. My recent work seeks to address the gap between relevance feedback, deep language models, and conversational search through different approaches that helps to improve the conversational system effectiveness with minimal efficiency cost.
