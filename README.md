### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Hang Li.

I am currently a first-year PhD student at ielab in The University of Queensland, Australia, I work with Dr. Guido Zuccon and Dr. Bevan Koopman. I was granted the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities in United States in 2016.

I am now working on developing different machine learning approaches to improve the effectiveness in conversational search settings, broader research topics include conversational AI, multi-modal system, and natural language understanding (mainly within the conversational scenarios).

Publications are listed in hangli.me along with corresponding github repos.
