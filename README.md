### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Hang Li.

I am currently a graduating PhD candidate and PostDoc in [IELab](https://ielab.io) at [The University of Queensland, Australia](https://www.uq.edu.au/), I work with [Prof. Guido Zuccon](https://ielab.io/people/guido-zuccon.html), [Associate Prof. Bevan Koopman](https://bevankoopman.github.io/), and [Dr. Ahmed Mourad](https://ielab.io/people/ahmed-mourad.html). I was granted the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the [College of Science & Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/) at the [University of Minnesota Twin-Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) in United States in 2016.

I am working at the intersection of Information Retrieval (IR), Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), where I investigate how to utilises different feedbacks signals to empower the IR system with LLMs and NLP. My recent work seeks to address the exisiting gaps through different approaches that helps to improve the IR system effectiveness with minimal efficiency cost.
